        My Journey into Astrology
      </h2>
      <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-200 mb-4 font-mono text-center">
        Ever since I was a child, I was deeply fascinated by the sky â€” the movement of the moon, the stars, and the mysterious connection between time, energy, and life events. As I grew older, this fascination turned into a calling. I realized that astrology isnâ€™t just about predictions; itâ€™s a sacred tool for healing, transformation, and empowerment.

      <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-gray-200 font-mono text-center ">
        I started my journey under the guidance of experienced gurus and learned the core principles of Vedic astrology and horoscope analysis. Over time, I blended traditional wisdom with intuitive insight, creating a system that is accurate, compassionate, and practical.
